EGYPTIAN MINING.
THE UM RUS CRUSHING.
As the Egyptian Market was sorely in need of a pick-me-up, the first results of crushing operations on the Um Rus were doubly welcome in London last week. Certainly for a beginner the mine makes a very creditable showing. In fact, market anticipations have been well exceeded, as, instead of a 10-dwt. average as expected, the total yield of 351 ozs. from the 445 tons of ore put through the mill gives an average value of 15 dwis. to the ton, besides which, it is stated, there are an extra 3 dwts. in the tailings. As a good 6 dwts. may be reckoned to have been lost over the new plates, under proper working conditions there is every justification for the belief that the Um Rus will turn out a 1-oz. proposition.

CREDIT LYONNAIS,
The report of the Credit Lyonnais for the past year, recently presented to the shareholders at the general meeting, introduces us to figures which are truly remarkable. Deposits (including current accounts) are £66,500,000, comparing with £54,800,000 in December, 1903 ; acceptances £3,700,000, as against £3,000,000; cash in hand and at banks £5,500,000 against £4,600,000;bills recievable, £41.000,000 against £33,400,000 ; current accounts, £19,100,000 against £14,100,000; and loans against securities and contangoes, £21,400,000 against £21,000,000. The net profits for this year amount to the exceedingly comfortable sum of £1,285,000. The Credit Lyonnais is, of course, a French institution, pure and simple, but the London agency is a greater factor in our own markets than most people suppose. The report states that London has made no less a contribution to the success of the bank during the past year than during former financial periods. The figures we have quoted are a certain indication of sustained progress and capable direction.

A COSTLY BLUNDER.
CANAL CO.’S DREDGER SINKS.
(From our Correspondent).
Port Said, Monday.
The Suez Canal Company's dredger "Pharoh II," which was lying in the entrance of the Cherit Basin, was taking in coal on Saturday night preparatory to starting work this morning, and by some strange oversight all her sluices and side-scuttles were left open, with the natural result that as she got lower in the water owing to the extra weight, she began to fill on all sides, and before anything could be done to save her, she sank bodily. As she sank her superior top-weight caused her to roll over on her sides, and her mast, funnel, and upper works wore broken away, so that she does not appear above water-line. She is an almost new dredger, worth some £35,000, and was only brought out to Port Said last summer to be used in connection with harbour alterations. Salvage operations have been commeuced by the Canal Company.

ST. MARK’S DAY.
To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
Sir,—"Many are the curious customs” (says the late Augustas J. C. Hare*) “which attend St. Mark’s Day, especially that of the 'bocciolo' or rosebud, which every one gives to her he loves best.”
It is a pleasing and appropriate idea to associate St. Mark’s on Tuesday next with love in both old and young, and especially for the latter, who may be looking forward to being united in the bonds of holy matrimony, on some happy day, beneath the flag of the Church of England. — Yours, &c.,

SUCCESSFUL CAIRO INSTITUTE
BRITISH RECREATION CLUB.
The second annual general meeting of the club was held in the club premises in the Tewfikieh quarter, on Saturday at 6 p.m., under the presidency of Crookshank, Pasha. In spite of the hot weather a large number of members were present: several members, including the Very Rev. Dean Butcher, sent their regrets for non-attendance, and a telegram was received from Assouan from Mr. E. A. Harrison, the late president, wishing the club a prosperous new year. The audited balance sheet for the year ending 31st March, showing a balance in hand of £179, was then read by the secretary and passed unanimously. Crookshank Pasha then gave an interesting review of the past year’s work, which was listened to with great attention and frequently interrupted by enthuastic cheers. When his Excellency undertook the presidency of the club last April, its financial condition was bad, the club being over $706 in debt, whilst the petty jealousies, quarrelling and bad feeling among various members of the club, very nearly wrecked the institution. A new committee, consisting principally of buisness members of the club, ably presided over by Dr. Madden, was elected, and thanks to the pecuniary support of personal friends of the president, and the determination of the members of the club to work unitedly and harmoniously together in the interests of inch a much-needed British institution in Cairo, the year has proved a great suooess, and the general tone of the club leaves nothing to be desired. There are now 800 subscribing members (P.T. 120 per annum) and 129 of than are new members since April 1904. The profits from all sources for the last six months amounted to over £300, so that the club may now be considered a good going and paying concern. During the year a second tennis court, a miniature rifle range, and a bowling alley have been built. Several tennis tournaments were held, for which the prizes presented by the members, and the competition, being open to ladies, was thoroughly appreciated by all those who were able take part. The main hall of the club was wooden floored during the summer, and the fortnightly dances which took place through the winter were well patronised and proved very succeessful. Several river excursions got up during the warm weather and were thoroughly enjoyed by all those who were able to join in them. A change was made in the internal administration of the club. An hon. secretary (Mr. Holmes) and a resident steward were appointed, who managed the affairs of the club under the direction of the committee, and a hearty vote of thanks was given to the hon. treasurer, Mr. A. V. Thomson, the hon. secretary, Mr. Holmes, the chairman, Dr. Madden, and the members of the committee for their excellent services during the past year. The rules and bye laws of the club have been printed and distributed to every member of the club. Several very successfull concerts, got up entirely by members of the club, and two entertainments, given by Mr. Scott Leslie, were held during the winter and drew good audience on every oocasion. The Christmas festivities induded an excellent tea, followed up by a huge ’Xmas Tree and a liberal distribution of toys suitable for all ages, from the baby in arms to the young boys and girls of 13 years, and was a great success. Nearly 400 people were present. Lord and Lady Cromer graciously favored the club with their presence, and after taking tea with the members, remained to witness the distribution of the presents to the young people, and the club owes a debt of gratitude to Lord and Lady Cromer for thus showing their personal interest in its wellfare. Wednesday, the "ladies' day," was by far the most successful of the week,and a large number of the wives and children of members avail themselves of the privileges of the club during the afternoon and evening. The sale of teas during these afternoons is undertaken by two lady members in turn, with excellent results financially and otherwise. Taking into consideration the number of families living in flats and small rooms, without a garden open space for children to play in, the president hoped the committee would see their way to have two ladies’ days a week instead of Wednesday only, especially during the long, hot summer months. Two very well attended classes, one for ladies and the other for gentlemen, for instruction in first aid to the sick and injured, under the auspices of the 8t John of Jerusalem Ambulance Association, were held by Dr. Madden. The president at the close of his address presented the successful candidates of the class, 10 ladies and 8 gentlemen, with the certificates for passing the final examination. He also presented Dr. Madden with 6 handsome volumes of the “Arabian Nights,” subscribed for by the members of the gentlemen’s class, for his voluntary services as their lecturer.
In accordance with Art. 14 the president and four members of committee resigned. Dr. Madden then proposed that Crooksbank Pasha be reelected president for the ensuing year, which was carried unanimously, with loud cheers. Several new members for the vacancies on the committee having been duly proposed and seconded, a ballot was taken and the following members were elected to fill the four vacancies caused by the retiring members. Dr. Madden, Messrs. Blake, Curtis and Ratcliffe. The president after thanking the members for reelecting him for another year, accepted the position the more willingly as, having already steered the club over troublous waters, he was anxious to see her in a safe harbour where she would be permanently moored. They had recently received a notification from the Egyptian Government authorities that the premises they at present occupied would be required in the near future for services of public utility.
When they started the club two years ago they knew that their possession of the land they occupiad was only temporary, and they now had to face the fact that, in about 12 months time they would have to go elsewhere. "The Egyptian Government, on whom we had no claims whatever for compensation in the removal
of the club, had very generously come forwars and offered the club a piece of ground in perpetuity on the opposite side of the canal in the main Boulac road, covering the same area as the club at present occupied and valued at £10,000 to £l2,000-which would remain as a valuable asset to the club. It is true we have sunk, about £1,700 capital in the building of the present club, and that a portion of this, such as price of labour, etc., is absolutely lost. We have, however, no claim for damages or loss against the Egyptian Government, and the generous valuable asset of which they make us a gift in the new premises, obliges us to look for other methods in raising the necessary funds for the transfer and building of the new Recreation Club. I am authorised to state that if every other method fails Mr. Maohell, whose interest in the club is unflagging, and myself will find the money required.”

The Delta Light Railway Company’s annual sports were held at Damanhour on Saturday last, and notwithstanding the vigour of the khamseen, were very successful. There was a large and fashionable gathering of Europeans, including a number of visitors from Alexandria, Cairo, and Tantah. The sports were held on the company’s grounds and were enlivened by the band of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, kindly lent by the O. C. The sports began at 2 P.M. and continued without interruption until 7 pm. The championship was won by Mr. R. M. Ross. Mr. Spencer Whiteman unfortunately broke his collar bone in the sack race, After winning three events this was very unfortunate as he would otherwise have given a good account of himself and have run Mr. Boss very close for ths championship. Mrs. Aitken gave away the prises, which were both handsome and costly.
