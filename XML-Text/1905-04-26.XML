<p>Happiness in the Harem.—Discontented women, according to an American girl quoted here, should at once join a harem. "I" can assure my American sisters," she is reported to-say, "that they can dream of no greater bliss than to enter a rich nd well-bred Eastern gentleman's harem." Sue has tried the life herself, and is happy as the day is long since she became one of the wives of a potentate, described as Nasruilah Khan, "In a harem," she continues,"life glides softly, like a sweet, peaceful dream. Each wife has her servants. Our slaves obey our least sign of command, and they can never leave us. We can punish their least fault hy cutting off their heads, or, at any rate, having them flogged." This sounds alluring, indeed. Finally, it appears that bad temper, sceces, jealousies, bickerings, are unknown in a harem, and the lord and master is unflaggingly attentive, and never grumbles. The lady urges all American girls to find a harem instantly, and apply for a berth therein, if they want to know perfect bliss, ("Daily Telegraph's" Paris correspondent).</p> </div>

<head>STATE OF ZAGAZIG.</head>
<p>A correspondent at Zagazig writes :—</p>
<p>The greater the attempt to push Zagazig ahead, the more it falls back, and becomes remarkable for an increase of filth and darkness. The few petroleum lamps we have remain unlit when the moon shines, although she may not rise till 11 o'clock at night! This being the case, in Rue Tewfik, a street nearly a mile long, there are frequent collisions in the darkuess between foot passengers and carts, carriages, and donkeys coming from the interior, in Rue Tewfik are two of the principal banks and two churches; many well-to-do people reside in it, and yet it has been frequently pitch dark there of late.</p>
<p>The dyke is nothing but a place of convenience for the occupants of the huts and hovels of the quarter, and much indecency meets the eyes of the ladies and young girls coming trom the Greek and French schools, who have to pass nearly naked men on the road. And all this takes place under a regime in which British influence is paramount!</p></div>

<head>STATE RAILWAY SERVICE
SUMMERTIME TABLE.</head>
<p>The following changes in the time-table of the Government Railways come into force on May 1:—</p>
    
<p>ALEXANDRIA LINE.</p>
<p>The train de luxe between Alexandria and Cairo and vice versa at noon has been abolished.</p>
<p>The afternoon express will leave Cairo at 6.35 p.m. (instead of 4.45 p.m.) and the corresponding train from Alexandria at 6 p.m. (instead of 4.25) and a restaurant car will be attached to each.</p>
<p>The 4.15 p.m. train from Cairo and the 3.46 p.m. train from Alexandria will be considered as express trains and will stop at a few stations (see time table).</p>
<p>The 3.10 p.m. mixed train from Cairo and the 2.10 p.m. mixed train from Alexandria will be proiouged, the first as far as Cairo and the other as far as Alexandria, to pick up and set down express train passengers. The 10 a.m. mixed train from Alexandria has been changed to 10.50 a.m. owing to the suppression off the train de luxe.</p>

<p>BARRAGE LINE.</p>
<p>All the trains have been extended to Cairo, consequently the train which used to leave the Barrage for Calioub at 7.22 has been altered so as to leave at 6.22 p.m., arriving in Cairo at 6.55 p.m., and the train which used to leave Calioub at  8 p.m. for the Barrage has been altered so as to leave Cairo at 7.30 direct for the Barrage, and the train leaving the Barrage at 2.55 p.m. will leave at 2.15 p.m.</p>

<p>TEH EL BAROUD LINK</p>
<p>So as to improve the service on this line, two new trains have been added, one leaving Teh el Baroud at 6.15 a.m. and the other leaving Cairo at 6 p.m. The present afternoon service has therefore been modified as follows.
The 3.30, p.m. train from Cairo will hence forth leave at 1.45, p.m. and the 5.10 p.m. train from Teh el Baroud 5 minutes later.</p>

<p>CAIRO LUXOR LINE</p>
<p>A new fast service between Cairo and Minieh will be established.</p>
</div>
<div type="item">
<head>THE KHEDIVE.</head>
<p>The Khedive will leave Cairo by special tram on Thursday, 4th May, for Alexandria, arriving here at 11.30 a m. His Highness will be accompanied by the Resident of the Council of Ministers, the Ministers, and the Financial Adviser.He will proceed direct from the station to Ras el-Tin Palace, accompanied by his mounted esoort, and after lauching at the Palace will go to Montazah.</p>
<p>The Khedivah will arrive at Montazah on the same day.
It is stated that the Khedive will probably make a cruise in the Mediterranean this summer.</p></div>

<head>LORD MILNER.</head>
<p>Lord Milner will be received in audience by the Khedive to-morrow.
Lord Milner is accompanied by Mr. Walrond, who was private secretary to the late High Commissioner. Mr. Walrond was formerly under Lord Milner in Cairo, having been on the Land Tax Adjustment Commission of the Finance Ministry from 1894 to 1897. He is the son of the Rev. M. Walrond and was born in 1870. He was educated at Harrow and Balliol.</p></div>

<div type="item">
<head>WARSHIPS IN.THE SUEZ CANAL.</head>
<p>Mr. Weir, in the House of Commons, having asked on what grounds the facilities for coaling and revictualing afforded to the Russian fleet during its recent passage through the Suez Canal were withheld from the Spanish fleet under similar circumstances in 1898, Lord Percy stated that the circumstances of the two cases were entirely different in the receut case of the Russian squadron, cool was allowed because the vessels were entitled under Rule 3 of the Canal regulations now in force to an amount sufficient to take them to the nearest port where they could obtain the supplies necessary for the coutinuation of their voyage, —and the amount which they had on board was not sufficient. In 1898 Admiral Camara might have claimed under the general principles of international law coal sufficient to enable him to reach the nearest Spanish port or some nearer neutral destination, but for the fact that the Spanish warships had already enough for that purpose, and further supplies were, therefore, refused on that ground.</p>
<p>There is a vast discrepancy between the letter of the Judicial Adviser to the "Times" on the same question, and the answer of the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Did the discussion in our columns on the matter necessitate a legal change of front?</p></div>

<p>At 5.45 p.m. the rendering of Gaul’s sacred cantata, "The HolyCity," began. The church was crowded and the chairs from the chapel were removed into the church to give further sitting accommodation.

<p>The Chaplain closed with the Benediction. Then ended the jubilee commemoration, which will long be remembered by all who were present.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the brass tablet are 26:40 inches. The block of dark marble in which it is mounted measures 35:50 inches.

<head>REMISIERS AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
<p>The following note to Lord Cromer's article in his Report on "Gambling in Futures," will arouse considerable local interest: —</p>
<p>M. Vercamer, the very able Belgian judge on the Mixed Court of Appeal, who has studied this subject with special care, has drawn attention to the harm which results from the employment of a number of “remisiers” or "half commission men" by the brokers at Alexandria. This view is confirmed by many other excellent authorities. This system affords an easy means to gain, for a time, considerable incomes by half commission broking. At first good-natured people pass business to the new comer, and he makes large brokerages. Then come fewer orders, and he has to speculate to maintain his income. The principal reason these "remisiers" flourish is the abnormally high brokerage of 1/2 per cenk on the value of the transactions paid at Alexandria, as against 1/4 per cenk, which is the customary rate at most Exchanges. If the brokerage were limited to 1/4 per cent there would not be a sufficient margin to permit of the brokers paying so highly for the servioes of “remisiers."</p></div>

<head>ABOUKIR COMPANY, LIMITED. PERSONAL AND SOCIAL
DIRECTORS' REPORT.</head>
<p>The following is the report of the directors of the above company, which is to be submitted to the shareholders at the eighteenth ordinary meeting which will be held at the company's offices, 134, Palmerston House, Bishopsgate-street, London, RC., on Friday, 28th inst.—</p>
<p>The total sales of land, including those of previous years, are as follows 3,420 19/24 feddans sold for cash, £47,665.3.6; 14.476 5/24 feddans on deferred payments, £446,310.19.2, Less discount on ditto £5,617.18.7—440,693.0.7, making 17,897 feddans, at £488,358 4.1. During the year ending 81st December, 1904, 2,723 feddans wore sold on deferred payments for £123,882. Of this area his Highness the Khedive purchased a further 510 feddans and he now owns a fine estate of 2,800 feddans of Aboukir lands, as an adjunct to his favorite residential palace at Montazah. Other sales were made to Europeans of 1,369 feddans, in hods of 300 to 500 feddans, for £57,900. About 900 feddans were also sold to natives, of which 800 realised about £60 per feddan, and the remainder about £45. These sales included all the land let or fit to be let, but the company will receive a proportion of the rents up to the dates the sales were made. The arrears of instalments due by purchasers on the 31st December amounted to £17,140, of which £4,675 has since been paid. After long negotiation the Government consented to the construction of the new syphon and head sluice referred to in the last report, and the work is now being proceeded with as rapidly as possible. The value of the unsold land will be materially increased by the large expenditure involved.</p>
<p>Mandara Division.— Pending completion of the syphon, no new land was taken in hand for canalisation. About 4,000 feddans were in various stages of reclamation, and, of this area 2,600 feddans were sold during the year. Two staff houses, of which one was sold with the land, have been built with the necessary offices, stables, and servants’ houses. The construction of staff houses has greatly facilitated sales of land and the company has at different times built ten, of which seven have been sold with the land. The tramway through the centre of the division has been a great boon; without it, the rapid development of the land would not have been possible.</p>
<p>Bahari Division.— Reclamation in this division has been retarded by the uneven state of the land, which required a great amount of levelling, but the position has now improved and more rapid progress will be made.</p>
<p>Wastani Division.—There are about 5,000 feddans in this division, and it is expected that at least 1,000 feddans will be canalised this year. A new staff house and some esbehs will be built, and the tramway will be extended along the bank of the new canal for a distance of about two miles to the Mahmoudieh Canal.</p>
<p>Cattle —In compensation for the cattle lost by the compvny in 1903, referred to in the last report, the Government have ceded a long a narrow piece of land containing abont 665 feddans along Aboukir Bay. In January there was another outbreak of cattle plague and the company lost abont a dozen cattle; later on malaria and foot and mouth disease caused sickness and some deaths, but the plague has now almost disappeared from Egypt. The young stock has done very well, and will more than compensate for losses by death and old age.</p>
<p>Work and responsibility having greatly increased during the year, as evidenced by the large sales of land and the heavy expenditure, Mr. Richmond has been appointed sub-manager, a position well earned by his continued good work and application for over six years with the company. Of the original 30,000 feddans possessed by the company, only about 12,000 now remain unsold, and the directors have felt that it would be a pity not to utilise the valuable experience acquired in land reclamation. They have, therefore, in conjunction with two other Egyptian land companies, acquired a valuable property in the province of Gharbteh of 1,677 feddans, with the intention of extending reclamation to adjoining areas when opportunity presents itself. From the accounts presented the profit and loss account shows a credit balance of £23,048. 17s. lOd., which, added to £3,780. 17a, brought forward from the preceding year, makes £25,829. 14. lOd. The arrears of dividend due to the Ordinary shares to 31st December, 1903, amounting to £9,057. 14s. 2d., or 10a lOfd. per share, srero paid in January, 1905, and it is now proposed to pay dividends for the post year of 7 per cent. on both the Ordinary and Deferred shares which swill amount to £11,769. 2s, leaving £6,002. 18s. 8d. to be carried forward.</p></div>
<div type="item">
<head>IMPORTANT PROPERTY SALE.</head>
<p>The site and buildings known as the Palais ds l'Anoienne Boone at Alexandria have been sold by the landlord, M. Laurens, to a native capitalist of Cairo for £24,000 All the expenses and costs of the transfer are to be borne by the purchaser. The block embraces a site of 1,882 square pics and includes the "Le Khedive” cigarette manufactory, the stores and bar of Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi; and the offices of the “Egyptian Gazette.” The reason for the sale was that M. Laurens finds his present premises too small for the cigarette business and he intends building a large cigarette factory in the neighbourhood of Messrs. Degiardi Brothers' works.</p></div>

Prior, took place at St. Catherine's Cathedral, Alexandria, on Monday last at 2 p.m. The bride, who was given away by her brother, wore a handsome gown of white satin trimmed with mousseline de soie and real lice. Her court train was of satin and mousseline de soie, and her wreath of orange blossoms was arranged over her long embroidered tulle veil. The bridegroom was supported by Mr. F. R. Acheson, as best man. The principal bridesmaid was Miss Mabel Lamb, who looked very pretty in a beautiful robe of pale pink chiffon silk. She wore a white chiffon hat trimmed with white ostrich plumes and ospreys and carried a bouquet of pink and white roes.
